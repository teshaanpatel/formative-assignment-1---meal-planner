Teshaan Patel â€“ IMAD Formative Assignment 1 Report

Purpose of the application

The purpose of this application is to help our friend Hera decide what to eat on a daily basis as she has a busy schedule and over complicates her meal choices.
As this has come to our attention we have created an application that would help her choose what to eat in the simplest way possible based on different times of day.
With this application she would be able to have simplified meal options that fit into her busy schedule while allowing her to have meal suggestions ready throughout the day.

Taking into consideration the application should be simple and easy to use while checking all of the correct boxes,
a clean design was chosen which contributes to making it easier for Hera to decide on a time of day and so that she runs into limited errors. 
As above the input line where she would type in her desired time of day, I have listed the different times that she is able to choose from, 
this is so that she would have an idea of what she may or may not input which makes it even simpler for her to not run into any typos that she may make.
The design of this application includes different colour buttons and simple instructions displayed so that she can easily suggest meals or clear and reset the displayed text 
and input she has typed in. a Green suggest button and a red reset button is provided, easily visible text with functions that are pre executed via the code I have provided.
